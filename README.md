# Blackfly Camera to LED sync
This software controls a custom external light source for a camera that provides a frame trigger. It was developed for Teensy 4.x or 3.2.    

The frame trigger of the camera is used to advance to the next illumination color. The lightsource intensity is adjusted using PWM modulation.  Using a 500 frames/second camera and PWM frequency of 50kHz will result in up to 100 light pulses per frame.

This software is desgined for a custom circuit with a FET driver and FET power switch. The gate of the FET driver is conencted to a PWM clock and the individual channel is enabled through the enable/disable pin. 

Up to 13 channels are configured but more can be added. When auto advances is enabled, each frame trigger first turns off the current LED channel, then activates the next one. Each channel has a pin associated on the microcontroller. There is one common PWM signal for all LEDs. Individual channels can be disabled/enabled in software. 

That last channel (14) serves for background measurements and, when enabled, an image will be taken with all LEDs off. 

A button can be attached to disable all LEDs via software. The button will need to create a conenction to ground when pressed. If the button pin is set to -1, this feature is disabled.

## Program Versions
Teensy 4.x version is most recent development.

Teensy 4.0 has more pins available than Teensy 3.0.

We need at least one pin from input trigger, one pin for clock and one pin for each LED channel.
## Example Work Flow

In **manual** mode, we can set each pin and channel individually. In **auto** mode the system will cycle through the settings based on the input frame trigger.

  - Disable Auto Advance: a
    - f:   set the PWM frequency
    - r:   resolution in bits
    - C:   set PWM pin
  - Load working channel from EEPROM: e.g. s0
  - Adjust working channel:
    - m/M: enable/disable channel
    - p:   set the pin associated to current channel
    - d:   set pulse width (duty cycle) on the channel
  - Save working channel: s
  - Enable Auto Advance:  A (pls make sure all is set correctly)
  - Save channel configurations to EEPROM: E
